##Project Description
In this project, we will analysis the global floods records from 1985 to 2008. Specifically, we will invesitgate the floods patterns over time, floods distribution across continent, causes of floods and relation between floods and air pressure. 


##Floods over time â€“ scatterplot, interactive plot


##Floods by continent


##Distribution by main cause / death : top floods causes , different from cause of deaths

name1 = c("heavy rain", "tropical cyclone","extra tropical cyclone","monsoonal rain","snowmelt","ice jam break up","dam levy break release","torrential rain", "tidal storm surge", "avalanche related")

```

Next, we did some analysis of main causes and death. From the distribution of main causes, we found "heavy rain" is the primary main cause of floods, over 2500 registers of floods are caused by heavy rain, which is much higher than any other causes. 





```{r, echo=FALSE,  fig.width = 15, fig.height = 5}
heavy_rain_death = sum(mod_file[grep("hea", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)
tropical_death = sum(mod_file[grep("tropical cycl", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead) - sum(mod_file[grep("extra", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)
extra_tropical_death = sum(mod_file[grep("extra", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)
monsoonal_death = sum(mod_file[grep("mon", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)
snowmelt_death = sum(mod_file[grep("snow", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)
ice_jam_death = sum(mod_file[grep("ice", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)
dam_levy_death = sum(mod_file[grep("dam", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)
torrential_death = sum(mod_file[grep("torr", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)
tidal_death = sum(mod_file[grep("surge", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)
avalanche_death = sum(mod_file[grep("aval", mod_file$tolower.file.Main.cause),]$file.Dead)


height2 = c(heavy_rain_death, tropical_death,extra_tropical_death,monsoonal_death,snowmelt_death,ice_jam_death,dam_levy_death,torrential_death, tidal_death, avalanche_death)
name2 = c("heavy rain", "tropical cyclone","extra tropical cyclone","monsoonal rain","snowmelt","ice jam break up","dam levy break release","torrential rain", "tidal storm surge", "avalanche related")
color2 = c("gray30","gray10","gray80","gray40","gray80","gray80","gray80","gray50","gray20","gray80")
barplot(height2, names.arg = name2, cex.names=0.8,cex.axis = 0.6, main = "Distribution of death", xlab = "main causes", ylab = "number of deaths", col = color2, cex.lab = 2, cex.main = 3)

```

However, although "tropical cyclone" and "tidal storm surge" have only around 500 registers, respectively, they were the main causes of death. After ordering the top 10 registers which have the most number of death, 5 of the top 10 registers are caused by these two natural disasters. Compared to the death caused by "heavy rain", less than 100000 people died in floods caused by "heavy rain", although it's the primary main cause of floods.

##M6 floods caused by heavy rain 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#library(ncdf4)
library(gdata)
library(MASS)
library(png)
```

From previous analysis, we found that heavy rain is the reason which caused the largest number of floods. Here, we researched on the floods caused by heavy rain that had a level of M6. We count the occurence of M6 level floods at each countries from 1985 to 2008. The countries with the largest 20 occurence are displayed in the following dotchart. From the plot, we can see that in the time period 1985 to 2008 China and USA have much more M6 floods than other countries. We then analysised the M6 floods in China.

!["plot 2"](M6_China.png) 

In this plot, we plotted all the floods locations with a level at least M6 happened in China from 1985 to 2015 with the death toll. As we can the most deadly floods happened in Hunan province.
