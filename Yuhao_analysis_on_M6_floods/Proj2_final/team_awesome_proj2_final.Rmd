##Project Description
In this project, we will analysis the global floods records from 1985 to 2008. Specifically, we will invesitgate the floods patterns over time, floods distribution across continent, causes of floods and relation between floods and air pressure. 


##Floods over time â€“ scatterplot, interactive plot


##Floods by continent


##Distribution by main cause / death : top floods causes , different from cause of deaths



##Displacement




##M6 floods caused by heavy rain 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

From previous analysis, we found that heavy rain is the reason which caused the largest number of floods. Here, we researched on the floods caused by heavy rain that had a level of M6. We count the occurence of M6 level floods at each countries from 1985 to 2008. The countries with the largest 20 occurence are displayed in the following dotchart. From the plot, we can see that in the time period 1985 to 2008 China and USA have much more M6 floods than other countries. We then analysised the M6 floods in China.

In this plot, we plotted all the floods locations with a level at least M6 happened in China from 1985 to 2015 with the death toll. As we can the most deadly floods happened in Hunan province.
