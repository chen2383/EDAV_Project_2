M6 floods analysis

In this analysis, we researched on the floods that had a level of M6. We count the occurence of M6 level floods at each countries from 1985 to 2008. The countries with the largest 20 occurence are displayed in the following dotchart. From the plot, we can see that in the time period 1985 to 2008 China and USA have much more M6 floods than other countries. We then analysised the M6 floods in China.

!["plot 2"](M6_China.png) 

In this plot, we plotted all the floods locations with a level at least M6 happened in China from 1985 to 2015 with the death toll. As we can the most deadly floods happened in Hunan province.
